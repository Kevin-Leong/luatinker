<b><details><summary>ping</summary></b>

Ping measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source.<br>
Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply.
